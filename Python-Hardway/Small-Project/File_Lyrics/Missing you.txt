All I hear is raindrops
Falling on a rooftops
of baby tell me where you have to go

Cause this pain, i feeling won't go away
and today, im officialy missing you.
I thought that from this heartache i could escape
Oh woah, and i falling all enought to know there aint no way.
And today, im officialy missing yo
