There i was, An empty piece of a shell
Just minding my own world, without even knowing
What love and life where all about.

Then you came, You brought me out of the shell.
You gave the world to me, and before i knew.
There I was so inlove with you.

You gave me a reason, for my being, and i love
what im feeling, You gave me meaning, to my life. 
Guess im gone beyond existing. 
And it all begone. When I met you.
